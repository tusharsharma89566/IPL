# IPL

This project is a comprehensive analysis and visualization tool for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data. It aims to provide insights into team and player performances, match outcomes, and historical trends using Python and data science libraries.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of IPL datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on teams, players, and matches
- Visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, etc.
- Player and team performance comparisons
- Prediction models for match outcomes (if implemented)
- Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for reproducible analysis
